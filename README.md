Clinical trial data simulation by Lakshmi Konduri

The dataset has been simulated using R on visual studio code. 
the dataset has been designed to emulate a 4-week long trial with a drug "A" and a placebo control group. 
the aim of the dataset was to understand the influence of increasing the dosage by a specific amount over a period of 4-weeks to understand it's safety and efficacy. 
The age and gender of the participants was collected to consider their possible influence on status. 
The status has been marked into 4 distinct categories : completed, death, information lost and withdrawn.
